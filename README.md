## Sales Performance Analysis

### Project Overview
**Sales Performance Analysis** is a data-driven project aimed at empowering retail management to make informed decisions regarding product offerings. By developing an interactive dashboard, this project will visually represent monthly sales performance across various product segments and categories, enabling stakeholders to easily identify which areas are performing well and which require attention.

### Background
Mike Goodman, the Product Management Director at a retail products company, is tasked with evaluating the companyâ€™s product catalog. His goal is to determine which products to continue selling and which ones to phase out.

### Objective
The primary aim of this project is to create a comprehensive dashboard that displays monthly sales performance by product segment and category. This tool will assist the client in pinpointing segments and categories that have met or surpassed their sales targets, as well as those that have fallen short.

### Domain
**E-commerce**
